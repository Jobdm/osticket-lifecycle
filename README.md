#### Intake: 
When an admin logs in they can see live tickets. Help Desk agents and Queue managers will be able to assign tickets to agents (including themselves) as well as assign the appropriate priority and SLAs.

#### Working the issues:
We are going to tackle `ticket #704724 - Entire banking system is down`. We start by making the following adjustments:<br/>
<ol>
    <li><b>Priority - Emergency:</b> The entire mobile banking system being down is costing the bank money.</li>
    <li><b>Department - System Administrator:</b> The System Administrators department handle these types of issues.</li>
    <li><b>Assignee - John Johnson:</b> John assigns himself the ticket so he can route the issue to the System Administrator department and make the department aware of the issue.</li>
    <li><b>SLA Plan - Sev-A:</b> The severity of the issue is very high. It needs to be solved ASAP.</li>
</ol>

</p>

<br />

##### Resolution:
 We transfer the ticket to `System Administrator` department. We informed the End-User that Systems Administration have been notified of the issue and that we would reach out once the banking system was back up and running. We then mark the ticket as `resolved`.
